/**
 * Pinned subwindows — keep a spawned child window (a confirm dialog, the Attack Modifiers window)
 * floating ABOVE the ordinary window it was opened from, so clicking or force-rendering the parent
 * never buries the child behind it.
 *
 * ApplicationV2 assigns window stacking order through `bringToFront()`: clicking a window and a forced
 * render both call it. We wrap it ONCE (the same idiom as registerShimmerOnReopen wrapping `render`) so
 * that whenever an ORDINARY (non-pinned) window is raised, every open pinned window is re-raised above
 * it. Among themselves, pinned windows keep normal click order (clicking one brings it forward); the
 * wrap only intervenes when a non-pinned window would otherwise cover them.
 *
 * A window counts as "pinned" if it is a DialogV2 — which covers every DialogV2.confirm/prompt/wait in
 * the system (the item-delete, IP level-up/neglect, shop buy/install/request, and preset-apply confirms)
 * with no per-call wiring — or if its class opts in with `static CP_PIN_ON_TOP = true` (the Attack
 * Modifiers window, which is a bespoke ApplicationV2 rather than a DialogV2).
