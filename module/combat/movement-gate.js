 *
 * Optional rule: restrict token movement to once per turn (CP2020 p.99 — a character gets one move
 * plus one action per turn, and the move does not cost the action).
 *
 * When the `restrictMovementOncePerTurn` setting is ON, during an active combat a combatant may
 * reposition freely UNTIL they take a tracked action this turn (which stamps the shared per-round
 * action counter — see damage-hooks.js `actionCount`). Once they have acted, further token movement
 * is blocked until the next round. GMs are never blocked (they can always reposition any token —
 * the GM override). Off by default.
 *
 * The "has acted this turn" signal is the same `actionCount` flag the multi-action system uses, so
 * the two features share one source of truth. So that the gate works on its own (without the
 * multi-action penalty being enabled), the weapon-fire increment in damage-hooks.js also stamps the
 * counter whenever this setting is on.
